## Cloud Password Game

A game to test your cloud and AWS knowledge by guessing the password based on the one-word clue.

## Pre-reqs

- An AWS account. You can create your account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
- Request access to an AI model (we'll use Amazon Titan Text G1 - Premier) on Amazon Bedrock before you can use it. Learn about model access [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).
- Optionally, an IDE like VSCode to experiment with changes to the app.

## Deploy the game

To try this out yourself, fork and then clone this repo into your own GitHub account.

Then follow steps 2 and 3 in the [AWS Amplify quickstart](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/quickstart/#2-deploy-the-starter-app).
